### Currently in Progress
This repository will continue to grow as I take more courses and update it with new materials. Feel free to explore the sections as they evolve.
### Content Language
Some content in this repository may be in Portuguese. (Ol√°! üòÅ) This is because the course materials and exercises are designed specifically for Portuguese-speaking learners.
### Project Repositories
Each major project I complete during these courses will have its own repository, with links included in this main repository. This approach allows for clear documentation and focused management of each project.
